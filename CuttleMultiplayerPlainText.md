# Setup

Dealer shuffles, deals everyone FIVE cards, and dealer gets SIX cards.  The remaining cards become a DRAW PILE placed face-down in the center.  The DISCARD PILE will start next to the draw pile.  Player to the left of dealer starts with the first turn.  Play clockwise.  If the draw pile is empty, shuffle the discard pile to continue play.


# Hand limit

SEVEN (discard down at the end of your turn)


# On your turn, pick ONE action:				
* Draw a card							
* Play a point card
* Play an effect card
* Play a permanent card

# Point Cards (Play vertically in front of you)
* Ace (1) through 10

# Effect Cards (Play by discarding)

* Ace	Destroy ALL points.
* 2	Counter an effect OR destroy a permanent card.  Anyone can counter at any time; place the two in front of you until your turn, discard the two and your turn is finished.
* 3	Revive a card from the discard pile, show everyone, and place it in your hand.
* 4	Everyone else discards TWO cards.
* 5	Draw TWO cards.
* 6	Destroy ALL permanents.
* 7	Draw a card and immediately play it (even if it is to your disadvantage).  If the card cannot be used, discard.
* 9	Return a permanent card to owner’s hand.

# Permanent Cards (Play sideways)

* 8	Everyone else places their hand face up on the table.
* Jack	Place on top of a point card to transfer ownership.  Stacked Jacks are possible.
* Queen	Protect your points and permanents from single attacks (TWO, NINE, and JACK).  A queen is always vulnerable to a TWO and SIX.  Your points and permanents are vulnerable to ACE and SIX.
* King	Each King you play lowers the amount of points you need
  * 0K  21+
  * 1K  14+
  * 2K  10+

  * 4K  5+


# Suggestions for faster play:
* When introducing the game, play a practice round first with all hands face up.
* Print multiple rule sheets and place them between all players for reference.
* Announce your turn.  Examples: “I am drawing a card.”  “I am playing an EIGHT for points.”
* Remind players of their turn.
* If playing with 4-8 players, remove an ACE and a SIX after each shuffle or as seen fit.


# Suggestions for advanced play or house rules:

* A long term points system could be added like with Rummy 500.  Keep a pen and a notepad around your deck of cards, write initials at the top of columns, and add up points at the end of each round.  First person to a predefined number wins the game.
* The basic game generally works with low point cards having strong powers and higher point cards having weak powers.  The ACE and TWO have powerful effects, the NINE has the weakest effect, and the 10 has no effect.  Try changing the rules for cards.  If you want to add more rules than the number of cards, card color can double the rules and card suits can quadruple the rules.  Jokers can also be added for a rule.  Temporary rules can be written directly on the rules page.
